This project is me learning C from Scratch. Scratching basically means that I am scratching the language to the core. I will try and go as deep ass I can, learn the syntax and use it to do some projects.

I know it is not an easy task, but I am ready for hard things. So far, easy things have gotten me nowhere!

I will document the progress of this project as I go. The aim is to learn the language and be proficient enough to know how to make systems and even more, learn the other languages which have C as their mother.

It haas began!
